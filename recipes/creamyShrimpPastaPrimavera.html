      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, or to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and
        cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook
        until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in mushrooms and bell pepper;
        cook until bell pepper has softened and mushrooms are lightly browned, 3
        to 5 minutes. Add shrimp, white wine, and oregano. Cook until shrimp are
        almost cooked through and turning pink, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cream and butter. Simmer, stirring constantly, for 8 minutes. Add
        cooked spaghetti, mix to combine, and turn off heat. If cream sauce is
        too thin, thicken with flour. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle
        with Parmesan cheese and basil.
